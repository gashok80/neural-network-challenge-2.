Attrition Rate
This code pattern is a high-level overview of what to expect in a data science pipeline and the tools that can be used along the way. It starts from framing the business question, to buiding and deploying a data model. The pipeline is demonstrated through the employee attrition problem.

Employees are the backbone of any organization. Its performance is heavily based on the quality of the employees and retaining them. With employee attrition, organizations are faced with a number of challenges:

1. Expensive in terms of both money and time to train new employees
1. Loss of experienced employees
1. Impact on productivity
1. Impact on profit

The following solution is designed to help address the employee attrition problem. When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand:

1. The Process involved in solving a data science problem
1. How to create and use Watson Studio instance
1. How to mitigate bias by transforming the original dataset through use of the AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit
1. How to build and deploy the model in Watson Studio using various tools
